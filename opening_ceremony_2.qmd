-   The Directors of the company present an expression of the different forces and social groups inputting into the establishment of the factories. At the centre of it all was the Dublin-based government, represented by Sean Lemass, the new Minister of Industry (&&), who had the rather enormous task of delegating dozens of new factories to the towns and even villages of Ireland. The problem for Lemass was that he was a Dublin City man, born and bred, and, by modern standards, only a young fella. So he didn't have sufficient connections around the country nor the experience to negotiate the "ruddy-faced gombeenism of rural political patronage which was foreign to Lemass". However, his twin hobbies of golf by day and poker by night gave him access to Dublin City's emerging new elites, and they provided a human bridge of sorts between him and the local town councils that were clamouring for industry and cash.

-   One such character was Vincent Crowley, a Portlaw native who was an accountant in the city. **MORE ON CROWLEY** His company, **Kennedy & Crowley** would eventually become KPMG. *It was he who clearly lobbied Lemass hrough Kennedy O'Brien who would become the first **Managing Director** of Irish Tanners Ltd in Portlaw and his connection to Lemass was through Vincent Crowley,* an accountant based in Dublin who hailed from Portlaw, and who clearly lobbied Lemass into into putting such a large operation into such a tiny village.

-   One reason for this was that the Department's predictions for the amount of leather needed within the state were grossly underestimated and Lemass later admitted that locating in Portlaw had been a mistake, even though it later grew into one of the biggest tanneries in all of Europe and, in the 1940s, a purpose-built factory would be put there. However, this overspill was to Dungarvan's advantage and O'Brien was on hand to straddle the two tanneries on opposing sides of the county. **WHY DID HE FLOG HALF OF HIS SHARES**

    -   Lemass enjoiyed rounds of golf and poker schools with the men he perceived to be Ireland’s movers and shakers. He created openings both for people who moved in his circles and for other aspiring businessmen, particularly in clothing and footwear, industries which required relatively little initial capital.

    -    “the ruddy-faced gombeenism of rural political patronage was foreign to Lemass \[, who was\] a slick city type”

        Nonethe less at the very least it can be said that the system he set up in the 1930s facilitated patronage of this kind

    -   Location was not just determined by national and social needs; industries appeared in areas where Fianna Fail needed votes too

    -   

        -   Lemass let big British companies set up operations with a few Irish directors on thiem, aware that the real decisions were made at the company’s headquarters in Britain. (Cadbury’s & Fry, Dunlop, etc)

        -   His anglocentrism aside, James H Thomas had come close to hitting on the raw nerve of protectionism: the lack of Irish Capital, economies of scale and know-how.
