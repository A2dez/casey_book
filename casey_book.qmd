*The factory’s grand opening on May 3, 1937, was a civic celebration. Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass, was welcomed with a full procession, including Reverend Walsh, Urban District Council members, and a Civic Guard Honour Guard. Led by the Dungarvan Brass Band, the parade drew huge crowds and transformed the town square with flags and bunting. Lemass opened the factory with a golden key, blessed by the Bishop, while the band played “Faith of Our Fathers”—a symbolic moment that underscored the factory’s spiritual and civic importance. A pair of slippers, tanned in the new facility, was presented to the Minister at the luncheon as a symbol of Ireland’s emerging industrial capability.*

#### Economic Background

Characters / Family Tree

-   Reginald Dickens (Leather man)

-   

Pierce Casey - known to William & Richard Fitzgerald <https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierce-casey-775235b5/>

Success at first Challenges - i want to explore the life of the person / people who shouldered the challenge - might be an upstairs / downstairs narrative, with a Casey / leader character and one or more workers from the town (maybe a family) - i'm thinking Landman
