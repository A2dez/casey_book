**Add family tree**

**Monday, 11 November 2025**

William has been aware of the rumour that the Monsignor was involved in the Irish Sweepstakes and he had been planning to post me a couple of books about the subject. He has also begun emailing older relatives to see if they are interested in getting involved in the project. Today I got a call from Pierce Casey the Second, and he wants to meet to tell me what he knows. He's absolutely delighted that the younger generation are interested and he believes that the entrepreneurship in the family is genetic. I couldn't talk for long as I was en route, appropriately enough, to Vincent's Hospital, yet again collecting my ever sicker wife, so we agreed to chat further very soon. It's not clear to me how much Pierce knows about the story as his father – Pierce Casey the First – died when our Pierce was just one, but he's pretty sure that a man of the cloth like Monsignor Richard was an ideal person to have involved, using his priestly garments as a disguise to smuggle tickets across D'Atlantic Ocean.

So I decided to do a bit of homework on the Irish sweep, as it was known, before I call Pierce for another chat. I had actually read a bit of one of those books on the topic, but maybe ten years ago, so my knowls are limited. I just know that there was a huge lottery run in Ireland with tickets sold worldwide and that it was legal in Ireland but not in most countries – if any – so the sale of tickets had to be done on the QT. So I jumped on YouTube and found some outrageous documentaries on the topic and, being stuck in the Third World traffic of Dublin City at rush hour, I had plenty of chance to full-on watch some documentaries.

The first one was recorded by the BBC in 1962 and [featured an interview](https://youtu.be/lefk0RCevlI?si=pycbIJvmYmNQKqR-) with Patrick McGrath, son of Joseph McGrath, who set up the Irish Sweepstake in 1930. Tickets were sold

RTE released a documentary in 2001, according to the comments, and to me it looked like 1993, inasmuch as that matter.s

Then I got a call today from Pierce Casey the Second, confirming the rumour and he wants to tell me what he knows. and Pierce got straight back by email then called me on the Tony. I spoke to him for a few minutes but I was on my way to pick up my wife from Vincents Hospital, yet again, so we agreed to chat further very soon.
