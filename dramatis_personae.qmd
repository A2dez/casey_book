The Casey Brothers - A Documentary A proposal for a 50 minute documentary about the Casey Family of Dungarvan, Co Waterford.

This document presents a proposal for a documentary that explores the lives of a family, the Casey family, from Dungarvan, Co. Waterford, beginning around the birth of the Irish Republic. The family rose to prominence as influential industrialists, playing a pivotal role in the creation and economic development of a rural town—and, ultimately, the Irish Free State in the 1920s and 1930s. Told through the eyes of two of the grandsons—Richard and William—the documentary follows their journey of discovery. Mapped over 100 years and spreading from China to California. Despite growing up in the same small town in rural Ireland as their grandfather, neither William nor Richard had heard much about the lives of their grandfather and his brothers. This film delves into the story of two brothers seeking to understand their root s, grappling with the question of whether it truly matters to know where you come from and why the past is worth exploring.

-   "perhaps the greatest industrialist in Munster if not in the country"

-   Two factories:

    -   Dickens Leather

    -   Glue and Gelatine

-   employment to hundreds of men from town and countryside

**Austie Casey** set up the first industrial factory in Waterford, called Dickens Leather. It later became the biggest employer in the town. The official opening was performed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass on 3rd May 1937. When he died in 1951 he was called Ireland’s greatest industrialist.

Peirce Notes on AGM 1951

-   already noticing the mythologising of Austie as having a great impact upon the town

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pierce Casey,** worked alongside Austi in Dungarvan, and took over the helm when Austi died. Pierce represented Dickens Leather at the World Fair in Toronto in 1948. He traveled the world seeking to export what the leather factory was producing. Pierce died in 1957. His obituary reported that he too was one of Ireland’s greatest industrialists.

**Joseph Casey**, went to Shanghai in 1917 where he worked for what is now Price Water house Coopers. He later moved to Southern California, where he settled and lived for the rest of his life. He had an accountancy firm. He was involved in overseeing the management of the leather factory. His company’s office was damaged by the 1933 Longbeach earthquake that caused 120 fatalities.

-   No mention of Joseph Casey (accountant in California). Might have already died

#### Reginald Dickens

" Sent on a tour by the ministry of Industry and Commerce on a tour of inspection to seek a seit for a Leather Factory"

-   Pierce 1951 report

-   **Reginald Dickens played a notable role in the UK leather industry, particularly in Northampton, a historic center for leather and shoemaking. He was associated with Dickens Brothers Limited, a company involved in leather production and tanning.**

    Here’s what stands out about his UK legacy:

    ### 🏭 Dickens Brothers Limited: Northampton’s Leather Heritage

    -   **Northampton** has long been recognized as a global hub for high-quality leather and footwear. Dickens Brothers Limited was part of this legacy, contributing to the town’s reputation for craftsmanship.

    -   The company was known for its **oak leather drums**, essential in the tanning process. One of these drums became a symbol of the town’s industrial heritage and was preserved as a historical artifact.

    ### 👤 Reginald Dickens’ Influence

    -   While specific biographical details about Reginald Dickens in the UK are limited, his leadership in both **Dungarvan, Ireland**, and **Northampton, England**, suggests he was a transnational industrialist who helped bridge leather production between the two regions.

    -   

    -   His work likely involved **sourcing materials**, overseeing **tanning operations**, and possibly **exporting leather goods**, especially given Northampton’s strong ties to the shoe industry.

    -   

    ### 🧵 Broader Context: UK Leather Industry

    -   The UK leather sector has historically been tied to **rural areas with access to clean water**, such as Harrold in Bedfordshire, where leather dressing thrived due to proximity to the River Ouse.

    -   

    -   Dickens’ operations would have benefited from this infrastructure, contributing to both **local employment** and **international trade**.

    -   

    If you're curious about the industrial networks that connected Ireland and England through leather production, Reginald Dickens is a fascinating figure to explore. Would you like to dive deeper into the history of Northampton’s shoemaking or the evolution of leather tanning techniques?

In that year, the 'Cork Examiner' carried a full page feature on the new factory and gave a detailed account of the opening ceremony which was performed by Sean Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, later to become Taoiseach. GREAT FINANCIAL BOOST The formal opening of the Dungarvan tannery on Monday, May 3rd, 1937 was a special day in the life of the town. The factory itself had actually been in produc- tion nearly 12 months before the official opening and in that short space of time it proved to be of untold benefit for the district providing considerable employment for local residents. With the exception of some of the clerical staff all male labour was employed and almost all were local. In total there were 120 operators employed at the factory during the early days and the weekly payroll of about £300 naturally came as a great financial boost to the town. Factory employees were enrolled in special classes at the old Dungarvan Technical School where they were given training as operatives in the handling of the vari- ous machines. Formerly used as busy corn and coal stores, the new owners, Dickens Leather Co., had to make extensive al- terations to accommodate the premises to their purpose. As output increased the company later acquired the Dickens Leather Co. obtained a virtual monopoly of the Free State market for its products and future prospects looked bright. Incorporated on 23rd October 1935 there was great interest generated in this new tan- nery project. Of its nominal capital of £40,000, Dickens were the only factory in the Free State in- volved in the production of lining and upper leathers for boots, shoes and slipper manufacturers as well as leathers for the gloving, clothing, belt, braces and fancy leather trades.
